The CSS specificity rules can be quite intricate and lead to unexpected styling issues. For instance, consider a situation where you have conflicting styles defined for the same element, perhaps due to multiple selectors or inheritance from parent elements.  The browser might apply a style that you didn't intend because it has higher specificity, even if it seems logically incorrect in your workflow. Another common issue stems from typos in class names or selectors. This is a very common mistake where even small errors can make it difficult to track the source of the problem. The lack of error reporting in CSS makes these errors harder to find and debug.  Lastly, floating elements can cause unexpected layout issues if not properly handled with clearing techniques (like `clear: both;`) or flexbox/grid.  Overlapping or misaligned elements can be the result of such problems.
